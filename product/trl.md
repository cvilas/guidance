| 9   | System proven in operational environment                     | Full-scale production. Integration into customer systems. Continuous monitoring. Improvement and optimisation for costs, performance                         | Ready for unrestricted commercial deployment and support           |

- A system remains at previous TRL until milestones for the next one are achieved.
- At every step beyond TRL3, conduct field trials and gather direct user feedback for continuous improvement.
- The framework can be applied not just to system as a whole but to sub-components as well.
- Note that the framework does not inhibit iterative development. If changing end-conditions invalidate a component, start over.
