# Product

- Solving specific problems require deep understanding of the problem domain. So build that first.
  - Make it use-case driven. Generalise later, as more use-cases appear.
- Let [Technology Readiness Levels](trl.md) guide product development.
  - Do [requirements analysis](../process/requirements.md) to define a spec by TRL3.
  - Always report current TRL when updating stakeholders on progress.
- With hardware development, front-load effort on design.
  - Hardware iterations are slow and expensive. Aim the get to the right design with fewest iterations.
  - Hardware cannot be abstracted away easily. Make it representative of the final thing as soon as possible
  - Stable hardware platform is paramount for software development velocity. Identify V1.0 hardware development platform ASAP.
- With software development, 'bias to action'
  - Rationale: Unlike hardware, software iterations are fast and cheap
- UX focus: Design the system from the UX end backwards, instead of slapping on a UI at the end.
  - Hire UX experts to lead product development beyond technical proof of concept (TRL3).
  - Simplify workflows and user interactions required to achieve a goal with our product
- Simplify the tech stack  
- Always have a plan B for high risk R&D. Implement the easier/obvious solution first and deliver, while the harder/better solution matures over time.
- Most progress happens at system integration and delivery time, _after_ we think we are done. Build up the energy in the dev team for this phase of work
