# One to Ones

## Purpose

When peers feel like their input matters, they're more likely to remain loyal, engaged, and 
productive. They are also more willing to surface valuable concerns and suggestions.

Have 1:1s with direct reports biweekly and all indirect reports monthly to

- Track cultural alignment and gain feedback all the way down to the peers at the coalface.
- Detect and adapt to changes in operating context or conditions.
- Understand what you and I are doing well, and where we are falling short.
- Improve trust and transparency across the team
- Provide strong technical direction
- Remove blockers
- Coach for performance

## Guide

- Maintain a shared document (Google Docs will do fine)
- In advance of a session, have the person write and share their agenda items for discussion
- Make the following 'go-to' questions a recurring part of every 1:1, so subjects know to come prepared:
  - What one thing can I do to support you?
  - What could I do or stop doing that would make it easier to work with me?
- Listen to understand, not to respond. After asking the above questions, remain silent (count to six). Most people cannot endure long silence and they will tell you something.
- Close the loop (log the actions and feedback in the shared document):
  - Follow up and share actions taken based on feedback from the last session.
  - If feedback was not acted upon, explain why. When peers don't hear back after giving feedback, they will assume their suggestions were ignored.
  - Clarify goals and expectations are well understood
- Make giving feedback a habit.
  - Encourage people to talk to each other directly to resolve personal and professional issues. Avoid being the intermediary.
- Avoid canceling a 1:1 session. Meet for a short time even if there is nothing in the agenda.
