# How to make Hybrid work

Reference: https://hbr.org/2025/07/hybrid-still-isnt-working

This type of working is still new, and if we don't observe for regressions and consciously course-correct, we will end up with a worse work environment than how it used to be pre-COVID. Some tips worth considering

- Establish in-office 'anchor' days. Same designated days for all.
- Be deliberate about devloping social bonds between peers. Volunteer together in the community, have lunch together, pub after work on in-office days!
- Limit attendees in virtual meetings to only those involved in the issues or decisions to be made (Pre-COVID we used to be conscious about this, because meeting rooms have limited spaces. That constraint went away with online meetings. But there is a cost to adding attendees without constraint. It increases noise and dilutes decision making ability.)
- Camera must be on or don't attend the meeting! Make conscious effort to be as present as possible with other attendees.
- Consider setting aside designated hours on work-from-home days to be responsive (on Slack, etc) to coworkers' needs
- Encourage frequent 360-degree feedback (give and ask for feedback) to pick up on our own blind-spots
- Provide negative feedback only one-to-one. Face-to-face is better, else on camera. Not email, not Slack.
- Encourage employees to document their own performance and achievements. Easy to overlook these when we are not in the same physical space daily, to the detriment of the employee's rise in the organisation
- Promote people not on the basis of individual performance alone but how well they work with and support others. Interpersonal skills are even more relevant in hybrid/remote work
- Partner new-hires with experienced mentors
- Personally introduce new hires to key people in the company that they will most interact with. They may be reluctant to do so on their own. Or they may not receive the desired response if they do.
- Regular 1:1s to track wellbeing and to clarify goals/performance

Document processes and expectations. Fully remote companies (such as Atlassian/Gitlab/Canonical) do this best. Learn from them
