# Personal Development Planning

## Setting objectives

- Take a moment and reflect on your career aspirations (upwards, sideways). How can you employ your strengths, and 
where do you need to improve your skills, knowledge and behaviours in order to get there.
- Set 5 to 6 PDP objectives for the year. The objectives should fall into three broad categories
  - Team priorities
  - Role accountabilities
  - Behaviours (see behavioural traits to develop in the next section)
- Each objective must be set by means of measurable tasks and outcomes, and must have a timeline
- Agree with your team leader on these goals.
- Periodically review your progress and refine your goals, if required, during 1:1s with your team leader.

## Learning: 70:20:10 Model

Most of our learning comes from challenging ourselves on the job, some from observing and seeking advice from more
experienced members of the team, and the rest from formal training.

- **70%: Challenging Assignments**: Learn on-the-job by systematic analysis, trial and error, and practice. Leaders 
should delegate well structured yet challenging tasks to their reports, and provide constructive feedback for 
continuous improvement and progress.
- **20%: Developmental Relationships**: Seek direct coaching from peers, mentors and subject experts. Your personal 
relationships with them can often shorten your learning time, and help you develop in specific areas, technical or 
otherwise. Leaders should help identify these experts within the organisation.
- **10%: Courses and Training**: Learn by formal/traditional teaching methods (i.e. online courses, on-site teaching 
or university courses. Use these to upskill yourself on specific technologies and domain knowledge required for you to 
succeed in your present or future roles.
