# Personal Development Planning

## Setting objectives

- Take a moment and reflect on your career aspirations (upwards, sideways). How can you employ your strengths, and where do you need to improve your skills, knowledge and behaviours in order to get there.
- Set 5 to 6 PDP objectives for the year. The objectives should fall into three broad categories
  - Team priorities
  - Role accountabilities
  - [Behavioural](behaviours.md) traits to develop
- Each objective must be set by means of measurable tasks and outcomes, and must have a timeline
- Agree with your team leader on these goals.
- Periodically review your progress and refine your goals, if required, during 1:1s with your team leader.

### Template (example)

| Objective/Aspiration | Task | Outcome | Timeline |
| -------------------- | ---- | ------- | -------- |
| eg. of team priority: Get devops expertise in-house | Define role. Open a position for internal or external hire. | DevOps expert hired, integrated into team. | 3 months (April 2020) |
| eg. of role accountability: Improve my baseline programming skills | Enroll in the Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program. Implement capstone project related to my work | Complete the course. Apply lessons on X | 6 months (Nov 2020) |
| eg. of behaviours: Take initiative to improve our code quality | Integrate static analysis into codebase | Automated framework to warn developers, of deviation from coding standards | 3 months (April 2020) |

## Learning: 70:20:10 Model

Most of our learning comes from challenging ourselves on the job, some from observing and seeking advice from more experienced members of the team, and the rest from formal training.

- **70%: Challenging Assignments**: Learn on-the-job by systematic analysis, trial and error, and practice. Leaders should delegate well structured yet challenging tasks to their reports, and provide constructive feedback for continuous improvement and progress.
- **20%: Developmental Relationships**: Seek direct coaching from peers, mentors and subject experts. Your personal relationships with them can often shorten your learning time, and help you develop in specific areas, technical or otherwise. Leaders should help identify these experts within the organisation.
- **10%: Courses and Training**: Learn by formal/traditional teaching methods (i.e. online courses, on-site teaching or university courses. Use these to upskill yourself on specific technologies and domain knowledge required for you to succeed in your present or future roles.

## Tips for staying competitive

- Work on harware tech & physical AI. Rationale:
  - Software is easy. Hardware is hard. Do hard things. This kind of tech has long lasting impact (nuclear fusion, aerospace, defense, green energy)
  - Working on hardware/physical systems require physical presence. Eliminates competition from 'remote' knowledge workers
