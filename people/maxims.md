# Maxims to live by

## [Charlie Munger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger)

- Ideas:
  - Work on your best idea. Simplify. Take it seriously - Don't diversify
- Reading
  - Humans have been writing down their best ideas for 5,000 years. Read them.
  - Make friends with smart dead people. Read their writing. Steal their ideas. They don’t need them anymore.
- People
  - Don’t work with anyone you don’t admire.
- Business
  - What do you have an *intense* interest in? Do that for money.
  - Avoiding stupid mistakes is more important than being smart.
  - Don’t sell anything you wouldn’t buy.
  - Incentives rule everything around you. Look for them.
  - Great businesses are built by going ridiculously far in maximizing or minimizing one or a few things. Think Costco.
  - Many hard problems are solved best when approached backwards.
  - Clip your business and personal expenses. Small leaks sink big ships.
  - Only play games where you have an edge.
  - Avoid mob rule. Avoid demagogues. Avoid dogma. Avoid bureaucracy.
  - Develop durability.
- Behaviours
  - Avoiding a bad habit is easier than breaking a bad habit.
  - Learning is changing behavior.
  - Do the unpleasant tasks first.
  - Stop multitasking. Concentrate.
  - Don't confuse intelligence with invincibility.
  - Bad things will happen to you. It’s inevitable. When they do get up and keep going and remember the next maxim.
  - Self pity has no utility.  
  - Find out what you are best at. Then pound away at it. Forever.
  - Use money to buy freedom.
  - Self improvement has no end.

## Flight training

A few amusing but insightful life lessons from my flight instructor Tim Raby

- On discipline, practise, and following standard procedures: "Make sure the daily judgement calls and decisions you make look reasonable when they appear in the accident investigation report".
- On irreversible events: Once the engine has failed, the aircraft doesn't belong to you. It belongs to the insurance company. Forget saving the aircraft; save yourself and your passengers.
