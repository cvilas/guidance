# Maxims to live by

## Charlie Munger

- Ideas:
  - Find a simple idea and take it seriously
  - Work on your best idea. Don't diversify
- Reading
  - Humans have been writing down their best ideas for 5,000 years. Read them.
  - Make friends with smart dead people. Read their writing. Steal their ideas. They don’t need them anymore.
- People
  - Don’t work with anyone you don’t admire.
- Business
  - What do you have an *intense* interest in? Do that for money.
  - Avoiding stupid mistakes is more important than being smart.
  - Don’t sell anything you wouldn’t buy.
  - Incentives rule everything around you. Look for them.
  - Great businesses are built by going ridiculously far in maximizing or minimizing one or a few things. Think Costco.
  - Many hard problems are solved best when approached backwards.
  - Clip your business and personal expenses. Small leaks sink big ships.
  - Only play games where you have an edge.
  - Avoid mob rule. Avoid demagogues. Avoid dogma. Avoid bureaucracy.
  - Develop durability.
- Behaviours
  - Avoiding a bad habit is easier than breaking a bad habit.
  - Learning is changing behavior.
  - Do the unpleasant tasks first.
  - Stop multitasking. Concentrate.
  - Don't confuse intelligence with invincibility.
  - Bad things will happen to you. It’s inevitable. When they do get up and keep going and remember the next maxim.
  - Self pity has no utility.  
  - Find out what you are best at. Then pound away at it. Forever.
  - Use money to buy freedom.
  - Self improvement has no end.

## Paul Graham

- If you correct course at a high enough frequency, you can be simultaneously decisive at the micro scale and tentative at the macro scale. [[essay](https://www.paulgraham.com/users.html)]
- Writing is not just a way to convey ideas, but also a way to have them. [[essay](https://www.paulgraham.com/read.html)]
- The most successful investors are also the most upstanding. [[essay](https://www.paulgraham.com/ronco.html)]
- If something that seems like work to other people doesn't seem like work to you, that's something you're well suited for. [[essay](https://www.paulgraham.com/work.html)]
- Take extraordinary measures to acquire users in the early days of a business. This might mean doing things that don't scale. Scaling is easier to solve than getting initial customers. [[essay](https://www.paulgraham.com/ds.html)]

## Elon Musk

- Five commandments
  1. Question every requirement. Each should come with the name of the person who made it. You should never accept that a requirement came from a department, such as from“the legal department" or "the safety department." You need to know the name of the real person who made that requirement. Then you should question it, no matter how smart that person is. Requirements from smart people are the most dangerous, because people are less likely to question them. Always do so, even if the requirement came from me. Then make the requirements less dumb.
  2. Delete any part or process you can. You may have to add them back later. In fact, if you do not end up adding back at least 10% of them, then you didn't delete enough.
  3. Simplify and optimize. This should come after step two. A common mistake is to simplify and optimize a part or a process that should not exist.
  4. Accelerate cycle time. Every process can be speeded up. But only do this after you have followed the first three steps. In the Tesla factory, I mistakenly spent a lot of time accelerating processes that I later realized should have been deleted.
  5. Automate. That comes last. The big mistake in Nevada and at Fremont was that I began by trying to automate every step. We should have waited until all the requirements had been questioned, parts and processes deleted, and the bugs were shaken out.
- Corollaries
  - All technical managers must have hands-on experience. For example, managers of software teams must spend at least 20% of their time coding. Solar roof managers must spend time on the roofs doing installations. Otherwise, they are like a cavalry leader who can't ride a horse or a general who can't use a sword.
  - Comradery is dangerous. It makes it hard for people to challenge each other's work. There is a tendency to not want to throw a colleague under the bus. That needs to be avoided.
  - It's OK to be wrong. Just don't be confident and wrong.
  - Never ask your troops to do something you're not willing to do.
  - Whenever there are problems to solve, don't just meet with your managers. Do a skip level, where you meet with the level right below your managers.
  - When hiring, look for people with the right attitude. Skills can be taught. Attitude changes require a brain transplant.
  - A maniacal sense of urgency is our operating principle.
  - The only rules are the ones dictated by the laws of physics. Everything else is a recommendation.

## Arthur Clarke

- When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.
- The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.
- Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.

## Flight Instructors (various)

- On discipline, practise, and following standard procedures: "Make sure the judgement calls and decisions you make up in the air look reasonable if they were to appear in an accident investigation report".
- On irreversible events: Once the engine has failed, the aircraft doesn't belong to you. It belongs to the insurance company. Forget saving the aircraft; save yourself and your passengers.

## Unknown

- In group discussions that require decision making, the expert should speak last
  - The most junior person speaks first 
  - If expert talks first, it demotivates others from taking an opposing view
