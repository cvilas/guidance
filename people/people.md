# People

## Taking care of team

- Have scheduled periodic [1:1s](one-to-ones.md) with all direct and indirect reports.
- Encourage reports to maintain a [PDP](pdp.md) record.
- Encourage [contribution](oss_contrib.md) to open source projects
- Design an inspiring work environment with cultural reminders to do the best work we can

## Fight for the cause

> "Toilet overflows while the Chef is at hand? He's going right in with the plunger, and fast. No waiting for the toilet guy - he is the toilet guy now. In Bigfoot's army, you fight for the cause, anywhere you are needed" - Anthony Bourdain, Kitchen Confidential

## Hiring

- Hire robotics domain experts first, with a couple of highly experienced generalist software engineers to set the standards and show the way. But robot development requires robotics experts.
- Do not hire roboticists in operations team. Make it representative of end-users/operators.
- Colocate development team and factory ops such that they can meet in one physical space often (many times a week). Full remote team members struggle to culturally align and collaborate.  
- Keep team small, frugal, well connected. It's hard to maintain cultural cohesivity and alignment in large teams with ever-changing conditions in the startup phase of a company
- Request for and review [work samples](work_samples.md) from prospective hires.

## Leading

- Follow the [leaders' code](leaders_code.md)
