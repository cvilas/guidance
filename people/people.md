> "Toilet overflows while the Chef is at hand? He's going right in with the plunger, and fast. No waiting for the toilet guy - he is the toilet guy now. In Bigfoot's army, you fight for the cause, anywhere you are needed" - Anthony Bourdain, Kitchen Confidential

Fight for the cause. Role and seniority does not matter. We do what we need to do.

## Hiring

- Aim for intellectual diversity with a mix of experts from different domains
- Request for and review [work samples](work_samples.md) from prospective hires
- Colocate development team or make it possible to meet in one physical space often. Rationale: Fully remote peers struggle to culturally align and collaborate
- Keep team small. Rationale: Minimise payroll cost (atleast until revenue), cultural misalignment, cost of communication, decision-making latency

## Leading

- Follow the [leaders' code](leaders_code.md)
- Encourage team members to [contribute](oss_contrib.md) to open source projects _we use_
- Maintain a physical work environment that inspires great work (I need to flesh this out a bit. Examples are: clean labs, Artifacts/icons of greatness we wish to emulate or exceed. Exact details TBD)

## Taking care of team

- Have scheduled, periodic [1:1s](one-to-ones.md) with all direct and indirect reports
- Set high expectations for [behaviours](behaviours.md)
- Encourage reports to maintain a [PDP](pdp.md) record
