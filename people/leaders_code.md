# Leadership Code

## Core principles

- What [motivates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc) all of us is autonomy, mastery and sense of purpose. Deliver that.
- Provide vision and operating context, not control.
- A good place of work is defined by
  - Inspiring mission
  - Inspiring colleagues
  - Creative freedom
  - Inspiring office environment

As a Leader, I shall:

- Be humble. Building things in the physical world is hard, and can go wrong in many interesting ways.
- Hold on to strong views loosely. Conviction provides direction to the team. But, when evidence to the contrary presents itself, change views.
- Commit once a decision is made, even if I disagree. (It's common for intelligent/reasonable people to disagree)
- Not dismiss something (tech, policy, process) that does not work without asking the questions 'could it work?' and 'What needs to change to make it work?' (That it doesn't work is stating the obvious.)
- Hold the urge to complain. Propose solutions. Build consensus. Move forward. It's hard work, but the right thing to do.
- Accept that mistakes/failures are natural part of learning. Engage end-users with the product/process early and often, so we can make those mistakes early and course-correct cheaply and often
- Understand what motivates each person in my team. Then do my best to maximise opportunities around that.
- Incentivise behaviours, not outcomes (Closely related to James Clear's [Identity-Based Habits](https://jamesclear.com/identity-based-habits))
- Trust people to come up with solutions better than I could and let them drive it.
- Think positively. Pessimism feels intellectual, but it ain't ('Seduction of Pessimism' - chapter 17 - [The Psychology of Money](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Psychology-Money-Timeless-lessons-happiness-ebook/dp/B084HJSJJ2))
- Ruthlessly prioritise. In a Startup, essential things get done first. The important ones may not get done until later.
- Not blindly copy the established giants. We are not Google. What may be right for them may not be right for us. This includes ways of working, scale of operations, and engineering philosophy.
- Always be in bootstrapping mode until revenue positive
  - Know how much it costs to run my team. Optimise fixed operational costs (e.g.: cloud services, software license fees)
  - Reduce the ratio of non-engineers (Eg: project managers) to engineers. Senior engineers are qualified enough to serve in these roles.
- Accept that for all issues concerning my team, including their productivity and well-being, the buck stops with me.
- Not micromessage. The message that goes to the CEO is the message that goes to the shop floor, is the message that goes to the customer. Micromessaging is dishonest.
- Set high standards for work and behaviours. There will be pressure to lower those standards everyday. I won't do it.
- Mentor and train my replacement, so I can move on/continue to learn/create further impact.
- Pay well. Pay grade directly sets behavioural and performance expectations.
- Reward and support hyper-performers in every possible way, not just in renumeration. Eg: higher autonomy, authority, responsibility

> I shall encourage my team to call me out if I am perceived to be breaking the code above

## Additional notes to self on team management

- Delegate:
  - Ask myself: "Am I the best, cheapest person to do this work?" If not, pass it on to one who is.
  - Follow this rule all the way down from C-suite to the most junior employee. Now you have an organisation where everyone is doing the most valuable work they can.
  - This frees up capacity at the top to handle the most expensive problems (where the leaders happen to be the cheapest and best placed to solve them)
- In 1:1s, provide technical direction and remove blockers. Coach, not parent.
- Invest more of my time in supporting and coaching higher performers.
- Keep expanding and sharpening my technical skills as I expand my administrative skills.
- Follow [hiring guidelines](hiring.md), but only hire people better than me (in the area of expertise they are being hired for)
- Perform like a professional athlete. Push beyond the edge of my abilities a little bit every day. Have the patience to let my capabilities compound over time. 
- Take time off to do personal projects on the side
- Work from places other than home or office occasionally.
- Take the time to read for pleasure.
- Take the time for frequent long walks (3-4 times a week) untethered to devices
- Every week, set aside time to pick an unfamiliar area of work my team is engaged in (eg: codebase). Study it to understand it. Leave it in better shape than I found it - fix issues, document, clean up. Do this with intent to build my own knowhow and skills
- My personal role models are consultant medical doctors and airline pilots. They are life-long practitioners of their craft.

## On Benefits

- When employing people, offer benefits, not perks
  - Benefits (pension, life assurance) offer long-term value to employees
  - Perks (coffee) are nice-to-have but they don't motivate. When money is tight, these must go first.
  - Don't offer anything for free (eg: lunch). Make all internal services self-sustaining.
- When solving customer problems, offer benefits, not features
  - "5000 songs in your pocket", not "5GB hard disk" (first ipod)
