# Leadership Code

As a Leader, I shall:

- Be humble. Building things in the physical world is hard, and can go wrong in many interesting ways.
- Hold on to strong views loosely. Conviction provides direction to the team. But, when evidence to the contrary presents itself, change views.
- When something (tech, policy, process) does not work, instead of dismissing it outright, ask the question - 'could it work?' 'What needs to change to make it work?' (That it doesn't work is stating the obvious. Takes intellect to go beyond.)
- Mistakes/Failures are explicitly OK. It's natural path to learning. Engage end-users with the product/process early and often, so we can make those mistakes early and course-correct cheaply and often)
- Incentivize behaviours, not outcomes (TODO: Link James Clear)
- Trust people to come up with solutions better than I could and let them drive it.
- Hold the urge to complain. Propose solutions. Build consensus. Move forward. It's hard work, but the right thing to do.
- Think positively. Pessimism feels intellectual, but it ain't ('Seduction of Pessimism' - chapter 17 -Â [The Psychology of Money](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Psychology-Money-Timeless-lessons-happiness-ebook/dp/B084HJSJJ2))
- Ruthlessly prioritise. In a Startup, essential things get done first. The important ones may not get done until later.
- Not blindly copy the established giants. We are not Google. What may be right for them may not be right for us. This includes ways of working, scale of operations, and engineering philosophy.
- Always be in bootstrapping mode until revenue positive
  - Know how much it costs, excluding salaries, to run my team. Optimise fixed operational costs (e.g.: cloud services, software license fees)
