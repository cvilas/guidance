# How to interview

Realise that as an interviewer, you are not just a gatekeeper bit an ambassador for your organisation.

- Request for and review [work samples](./media/work_samples.pdf) from prospective hires
  - Don't make them do [homework](./media/homework.pdf)
- Give them the driver's seat
  - Ask about moments of pride they had in their careers. Seek to understand what drives them.
  - "What questions did you wish I asked?"
  - Tell them to come prepared to show off their work, as described [here](./media/colleagues_wanted.pdf)
- Give them a challenge
  - Introduce the candidate to specific problems they would be working on if they were to join. Seek their insights. Since it is an ongoing problem, there are no right answers. But if they seem uninterested or uninsightful, they are unlikely to be fit for the role.
