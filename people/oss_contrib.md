# Open source contribution policy

> Can I contribute bug fixes back into open source projects we use, on company time?

tl;dr: Sure you can, and I encourage you to do so!

- The Open Source model works only if users keep their end of the bargain. Be good members of the community and contribute back where there is an opportunity to do so. Leave it better than you found it. It's morally and ethically the right thing to do.
- As a company, if we are using an open source project in our product, then we gained from not having to commit resources to build the same functionality ourselves. It's perfectly OK to report bugs, raise pull requests for bug fixes, etc during your work hours.
- As a team, we are always looking to hire smart, expert software engineers. We demand code samples. We are impressed when they demonstrate bits of work that they have done and made available to the public. If we expect those high standards from people who want to join us, we should provide opportunities to those already within the team to build their professional profiles in the same way.

So go and make an impact, both within the company as well in the community. And earn some street cred.
