# How to hire

## General principles

- Colocate development team or make it possible to meet in one physical space often. Rationale:
  - Robotics development is centered around hardware. Being in the same space speeds up problem solving
  - Fully remote peers struggle to culturally align and collaborate
- Keep team small. Rationale:
  - Minimise cultural misalignment
  - Minimise cost of communication and decision-making latency
- In prospective hires, seek:
  - Intellectual diversity (be open to talent from unrelated domains)
  - Spiky talent (generalists with deep expertise in specific areas)
  - Craftmanship (ability to build things in the physical world from first principles)
  - Humility

## Interview guidelines

Realise that as an interviewer, you are not just a gatekeeper but an ambassador for your organisation.

- Request for and review [work samples](./media/work_samples.pdf) from prospective hires
  - Don't make them do [homework](./media/homework.pdf)
- Give them the driver's seat
  - Ask them to come prepared to show off their work, as described [here](./media/colleagues_wanted.pdf)
  - Ask about moments of pride they had in their careers. Seek to understand what drives them.
  - "What have you built that you are proud of?"
  - "What questions did you wish I asked?"
- Give them a challenge
  - Introduce the candidate to specific problems they would be working on if they were to join. Seek their insights. Since it is an ongoing problem, there are no right answers. But if they seem uninterested or uninsightful, they are unlikely to be fit for the role.
