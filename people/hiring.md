# How to hire

## General principles

- Colocate development team or make it possible to meet in one physical space often. Rationale:
  - Being in the same space speeds up collaborative, hands-on problem solving
  - Fully remote peers struggle to culturally align
  - If hybrid working is unavoidable, set guidelines to [make it work](./hybrid.md).
- Keep team small (< 10). Small teams have
  - High cultural alignment
  - Low communication cost
  - Low decision-making latency
- Hire sparingly, and always with the aim to increase talent _density_
  - Prefer to train and promote from within instead of hiring
  - Only hire force-multipliers (the most talented people one can find)
  - Seek spiky talent (generalists with deep expertise in specific areas)
  - Filter for esoteric skills and interests, not the ones you commonly need. See [The Python Paradox](./media/python_paradox.md)
  - Seek those with an aptitude to build from first principles
- Seek intellectual diversity (be open to talent from unrelated domains)
- Maintain a balance of _innovators_ and _maintainers_ in the team. (Innovators are disruptive. Maintainers provide stability.)

## Interview guidelines

> Realise that as an interviewer, you are not just a gatekeeper but an ambassador for your organisation. Your conduct and professionalism directly shape candidates' perceptions of the company.

- Request for and review [work samples](./media/work_samples.pdf) from prospective hires. Don't make them do [homework](./media/homework.pdf)
- Give them the driver's seat
  - Ask them to come prepared to show off their work, as described [here](./media/colleagues_wanted.pdf)
  - Ask about moments of pride they had in their careers. Seek to understand what drives them.
  - Ask about moments of failures. Look for signs of humility. ("Describe an instance where you were wrong about something. How did it change you?")
  - Ask about things they have built and are proud of. Look for signs of craftsmanship, pursuit of excellence, aptitude for building from first principles.
  - Ask "What questions did you wish I asked?"
- Give them a challenge: Introduce the candidate to specific problems they would be working on if they were to join. Seek their insights. Since it is an ongoing problem, there are no right answers. But if they seem uninterested or uninsightful, they are unlikely to be fit for the role.
- Look for signs of curiosity: Do they ask a lot of questions? Do they dig deep?
- Test for character
  - Ask what personal rules and values they live by that are non-negotiable
  - Ask for examples where they have helped other people in their careers, especially those less influential than themselves
- End on a light note
  - Ask what was the last book they read and what was interesting about it. (Readers are thinkers)
