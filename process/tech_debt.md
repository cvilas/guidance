# On Technical Debt

Tech debt* accrues compound interest. Meaning, short cuts we take early on in our project will be harder to fix the longer we leave it that way.

Aim to resolve them asap. Assign a certain about of time per sprint to do so. Your colleagues will not thank you for the time, because nobody notices a potential future problem that was averted. But it will raise our competence as individual craftsmen and as a team.

(*Work that was the best we could genuinely come up with given our abilities at the time, which later turned out to be terribly wrong, is not tech debt.)
