# Code Review Guidelines

Follow [Google Code Review guidelines](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/).

Additionally,

1. All developers: Set aside time in your sprint to account for unplanned review requests from your colleagues.
2. Communicate:
   - Reviewers: When requested for a review, make your availability known.
   - Authors: Please give reviewers a heads-up on what the MR is about (if not in the MR description already).
   - In summary, make expectations clear.
3. Reviewer mindset:
   - Make actionable suggestions
   - Focus on API clarity and user experience. Less than perfect internal details could be improved in future MRs
4. Empathise: When asking for a review, you are asking for unplanned time from your colleague, who may be busy on their
   own tasks. Work with them at a personal level to get your MR through in a timely manner.
